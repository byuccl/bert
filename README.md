# bert - Bitstream Embedded RAM Transfusion


Start with [Huffman Tutorial](docs/tutorials/huffman/huffman.md).

We can put put our notes here to document our project.  As shown by the following link, we can include links to sub-pages of the repo and they get rendered when viewed on Github:
* [Nelson Notes 8/17/2020](NOTES.md) - these are Nelson's notes from the 8/17 phone call.  As we do things we can just check them off.

The right thing to do, however, if we think we will have a fair amount of documentation that we want to present to users, is to figure out how to use readthedocs.io to host our project documentation.  This seems to be what other projects like symbiflow and prjxray do.  

But, for now, we can start to use the `docs` directory until we figure out how we want to organize it.
