# Accelerated Translations

This has an alternate `mydesign.c` with acceleration tables.
* Copy the `mydesign.c` here instead the `mydesign.c` form hw_huffman.  The best way to copy is to use the GUIs.
  * Open your file browser next to the SDK window.
  * browse to `BERT/docs/tutorials/huffman/accel`
  * drag `mydesign.c` under the huffman_demo/src directory on the left pane of SDK
* To measure effect, run with [Timing `hellobert.c`](../timing/README.md).
* This should accelerate to physical and to logical translation times.
