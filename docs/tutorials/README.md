# Tutorials

The first tutorial to run is the [Huffman Encoding Example Tutorial](huffman/huffman.md).  The files you will need to run this tutorial will be provided to you.  You will create an SDK project and run the provided design files through the entire BERT process, culminating in running the design on an FPGA board.

Once you finish that, run the second tutorial on [Preparing Needed Files for the Huffman Encoding Tutorial](huffman/fileprep.md).  This will show you how to take the Huffman Vivado design and generate the needed files from it to use in the BERT process.  You will essentially re-generate the files that were provided to you in the first tutorial.  You can then plug them into your existing SDK project and re-run in hardware to verify all is still working.

Finally, you can work to apply these steps to your own designs.
